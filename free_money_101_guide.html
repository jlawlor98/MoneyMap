  <!-- Page 3: Budgeting Basics -->
  <div class="page" id="page3">
    <h2>📘 Budgeting Basics</h2>
    <p>Budgeting is the cornerstone of effective financial management. In this section, we explain three proven methods:</p>
    <div class="budget-method">
      <h3>📊 The 50/30/20 Rule</h3>
      <p>This method suggests allocating 50% of your income for essentials (rent, bills), 30% for discretionary spending (entertainment, dining out), and 20% for savings and investments. For example, on a monthly income of £3,000, you would allocate £1,500, £900, and £600 respectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget-method">
      <h3>📝 Zero-Based Budgeting</h3>
      <p>In zero-based budgeting, every pound you earn is assigned a purpose. Begin with your total income and subtract every planned expense until you reach zero, ensuring no money is wasted.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="budget-method">
      <h3>💵 Envelope System</h3>
      <p>This method involves dividing cash into envelopes for various spending categories. When the envelope is empty, you can’t spend more in that category. Digital versions of this system are available via budgeting apps.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Each method has its strengths—choose one that best suits your spending habits and financial goals.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Page 4: Emergency Fund Overview -->
  <div class="page" id="page4">
    <h2>🧮 Emergency Fund: Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>An emergency fund provides a safety net for unexpected events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent home repairs. Financial experts typically recommend saving between 3 to 6 months of living expenses.</p>
    <p>This fund is not an investment—it’s a secure reserve that keeps you afloat during tough times.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Page 5: Emergency Fund Calculator -->
  <div class="page" id="page5">
    <h2>🧮 Emergency Fund Calculator</h2>
    <p>Use the interactive calculator below to estimate your recommended emergency fund.</p>
